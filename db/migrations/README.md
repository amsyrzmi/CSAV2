# Migrations

Ordered, additive SQL files applied by `scripts/migrate.py` in filename order.
`apps/gateway/main.py::EXPECTED_SCHEMA_VERSION` must equal the highest shipped
version; tests import it from there and never hardcode it.

Reserved ranges (client growth program, 2026-10-27):

- `0470`–`0479`: lane A (WhatsApp channel, support refinements).
- `0480`–`0489`: lane B (subscriptions, HR access page, invitation mail).

Whoever merges a migration raises `EXPECTED_SCHEMA_VERSION` to the highest
merged version. Lanes never reference each other's tables.
